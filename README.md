# fhir-playground
A dummy app to associate "practitioners" with "organisations" on the test FHIR server at http://hapi.fhir.org/. 
Code is deployed at https://pm98zz-c.github.io/fhir-playground/

## Local use
You can run it locally with ´yarn start´, or build it with ´yarn build´. There's also a Dockerfile to run all the dependencies directly in vscode in .devcontainer.
